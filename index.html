      "28. Strike a superhero-esque pose and ask, “If I were a superhero, do you think this would be a good pose for me?”",
      "29. When you walk into the room, cover your face and say, “Please, no pictures, no autographs… I know I’m famous, but why must the paparazzi follow me EVERYWHERE!?”",

      "31. Use an auctioneer voice when offering snacks. Example. “Okay, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, what do we have here. We’ve got a delicious apple. Going once, going twice, SOLD to the little one in the front.”",

      "44. Simply make a loud, silly toot noise with your mouth when you squat down, jump, or do any movement.",

      "58. When the microwave or oven beeps, strike a different dramatic pose with each beep.",
